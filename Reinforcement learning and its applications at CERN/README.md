1. Markov Decision Process (MDP).
1. Dynamic programming (DP): Policy Evaluation and Value Iteration algorithms.
1. Maintaining exploration with epsilon-greedy policies.
1. TD(0) methods for sample-based RL: a comparison between SARSA and Q-learning.
1. Function approximation: train a deep reinforcement learning agent to control a [Lunar Lander](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/).
